📊 M/M/1 Queue Simulation Using Python
📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the simulation and analysis of an M/M/1 queueing system using Python.
It visualizes how the average queue length (Lq) changes with respect to the arrival rate (λ) while keeping the service rate (μ) constant.
The project uses mathematical queueing theory and graphical visualization to help understand system congestion and stability.
🎯 Objectives
To understand the fundamentals of the M/M/1 queueing model
To analyze the relationship between arrival rate (λ) and average queue length (Lq)
To visualize queue behavior using Python and Matplotlib
To ensure system stability by enforcing λ < μ
